# Git completion works by default with the latest version of git and zsh.

# # Uses git's autocompletion for inner commands. Assumes an install of git's
# # bash `git-completion` script at $completion below (this is where Homebrew
# # tosses it, at least).
# completion=`brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash

# if test -f $completion
# then
#   source $completion
# fi
